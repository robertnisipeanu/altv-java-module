# altv-java-module
Java module for alt:V

##  This project is abandoned, feel free to fork it and continue it under your name if you want to. However, keep in mind there are better alternatives with more performance and features (like the .NET Core module, which you can take advantage of all the work Microsoft put into .NET Core itself in the last years).
## You can find the .NET Core module here: ['FabianTerhorst/coreclr-module'](https://github.com/FabianTerhorst/coreclr-module)

## This is not a finished product

### Info

The C++ module itself is located in ./module, while the Java side of it (which handles java resources, events, passing data from resources back and forth to the C+ module) is located in ./alt-java
